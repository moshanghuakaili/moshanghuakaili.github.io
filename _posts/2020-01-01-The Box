I have a box.

I used to put many things into the box.

My pain, my sadness, my angryï¼Œ my passive, and so on.

One day, I put myself in it.


It is dark, obviously.

But safe, I guess.


Sometimes, however, I hope that somebody could help me to get out.

I still wanna see the blue blue sky.


But sometimes, I dont think so.

I am afraid that I cant stand the world.

It may be better for me to live in the box.


I am afraid that I hope too much.

And people will let me down, as they used to do.

And I know they will.


But I am just afriad but not blame.

I know I am such a person too.


I am focus on my pain, too much, maybe.


No one can save any other.
